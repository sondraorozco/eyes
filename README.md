## Project Description
This project was an assignment for the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course. This project uses Javascript to create two illustrated eyes that follow the user's mouse cursor as it moves across the screen.

## How to Run
You can run this code locally by downloading all of the files here to a single directory, using the same file structure. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to load the game.
